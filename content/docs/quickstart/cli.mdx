---

The Cronos402 CLI is an **MCP proxy node** that lets your AI client (Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.) connect to paid MCP servers on Cronos. It runs as a background process that handles payments automatically.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g cronos402
```

Or use with npx:

```bash
npx cronos402 connect --help
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Testnet Tokens

First, get some testnet tokens:
- TCRO: https://cronos.org/faucet
- devUSDC.e: https://faucet.cronos.org

### 2. Connect to a Server

```bash
npx cronos402 connect \
  -u https://example-weather.cronos402.dev/mcp \
  -e YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
  -n cronos-testnet
```

### 3. Use Environment Variables

For convenience, set your credentials as environment variables:

```bash
export CRONOS_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
export CRONOS_NETWORK=cronos-testnet

npx cronos402 connect -u https://example.com/mcp
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-u, --urls` | MCP server URLs (required) |
| `-e, --evm` | Cronos private key for direct wallet payments |
| `-a, --api-key` | API key for Cronos402 proxy authentication |
| `-n, --network` | `cronos-testnet` or `cronos-mainnet` |
| `--max-atomic` | Max payment per call (safety limit) |

## Payment Flow

When you call a paid tool, payments are **automatic** (no confirmation prompt):

1. CLI logs the payment details
2. Payment is automatically signed and sent
3. Tool executes after payment settles

```
💰 Payment Required:
   Network: cronos-testnet
   Max Amount: 0.01 USDC
   Recipient: 0x1234...5678
```

> **Tip**: Use `--max-atomic` to set a spending limit per call.

For more details, see the [full CLI reference](/docs/cli).
