The Cronos402 CLI lets you connect to paid MCP servers directly from your terminal.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g cronos402
```

Or use with npx:

```bash
npx cronos402 connect --help
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Testnet Tokens

First, get some testnet tokens:
- TCRO: https://cronos.org/faucet
- devUSDC.e: https://faucet.cronos.org

### 2. Connect to a Server

```bash
npx cronos402 connect \
  -u https://example-weather.cronos402.dev/mcp \
  -e YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
  -n cronos-testnet
```

### 3. Use Environment Variables

For convenience, set your credentials as environment variables:

```bash
export CRONOS_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
export CRONOS_NETWORK=cronos-testnet

npx cronos402 connect -u https://example.com/mcp
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-u, --urls` | MCP server URLs (required) |
| `-e, --evm` | Cronos private key |
| `-n, --network` | `cronos-testnet` or `cronos-mainnet` |
| `--max-atomic` | Max payment per call |

## Payment Flow

When you call a paid tool:

1. CLI shows payment details
2. You confirm the payment
3. Payment is signed and sent
4. Tool executes after payment settles

```
Payment Required:
  Network: cronos-testnet
  Amount: 0.01 USDC
  Recipient: 0x1234...5678

Accept? [Y/n]
```
