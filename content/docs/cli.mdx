description: Command-line interface for connecting to paid MCP servers on Cronos
---

The Cronos402 CLI is an **MCP proxy node** that connects your AI client (like **Cursor**, **Claude Desktop**, or other MCP-compatible apps) to paid MCP servers on Cronos. It handles wallet management and payment flows **automatically** — no manual confirmation required.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g cronos402
```

Or use directly with npx:

```bash
npx cronos402 connect --help
```

## Usage

### Connect to a Paid MCP Server

```bash
cronos402 connect -u https://example.com/mcp -e YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY -n cronos-testnet
```

### Options

| Option | Alias | Description | Environment Variable |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| `--urls` | `-u` | Comma-separated MCP server URLs (required) | - |
| `--evm` | `-e` | Cronos private key for wallet payments | `CRONOS_PRIVATE_KEY` |
| `--api-key` | `-a` | API key for proxy authentication | `API_KEY` |
| `--network` | `-n` | Network: `cronos-testnet` or `cronos-mainnet` | `CRONOS_NETWORK` |
| `--max-atomic` | - | Maximum payment limit in atomic units | `X402_MAX_ATOMIC` |

## How the CLI Works

The CLI runs as a **stdio MCP server** that acts as a bridge between your AI client and remote MCP servers. When you configure your AI client (like Cursor) to use the CLI, it:

1. Receives MCP requests from your AI client
2. Forwards them to the remote server
3. If payment is required (402 response), automatically handles the payment
4. Returns the result to your AI client

This is **not** a script you run manually for each transaction — it's a persistent node that your AI client connects to.

## Payment Modes

The CLI supports two payment modes that can be used together or separately:

### 1. Wallet Mode (Direct Payments with `--evm`)

Use your Cronos wallet to pay for tools directly. Payments are **automatic** — the CLI signs and submits without prompting:

```bash
cronos402 connect \
  -u https://weather-api.example.com/mcp \
  -e 0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
  -n cronos-testnet
```

When a tool requires payment, the CLI will:
1. Display the payment details (network, amount, recipient) in logs
2. **Automatically sign and submit** the payment (no confirmation prompt)
3. Retry the tool call after payment settles

> **Safety Note**: Use `--max-atomic` to set a payment limit per call. This prevents unexpected large charges.

### 2. API Key Mode (Proxy Authentication with `--api-key`)

Use an API key to authenticate with a Cronos402 proxy that handles payments on your behalf:

```bash
cronos402 connect \
  -u https://proxy.cronos402.dev/mcp \
  -a YOUR_API_KEY
```

In this mode, the proxy (cronos402.dev) pays for the tools using your pre-funded account balance.

### Combined Mode

You can use both API key (for proxy authentication) and EVM wallet (for direct payments to non-proxy servers) together:

```bash
cronos402 connect \
  -u https://proxy.cronos402.dev/mcp,https://other-server.com/mcp \
  -a YOUR_API_KEY \
  -e 0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
  -n cronos-testnet
```

## Environment Variables

You can set credentials via environment variables instead of command-line flags:

```bash
export CRONOS_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
export CRONOS_NETWORK=cronos-testnet
export X402_MAX_ATOMIC=1000000  # Max 1 USDC per payment

cronos402 connect -u https://example.com/mcp
```

## Payment Logging

When a tool requires payment, you'll see a log message (not a prompt):

```
💰 Payment Required:
   Network: cronos-testnet
   Max Amount: 0.01 USDC
   Recipient: 0x1234...5678
```

The CLI **automatically accepts and processes** the payment — there is no interactive confirmation prompt. This is by design, as the CLI runs as a background proxy for your AI client.

> **Important**: Use `--max-atomic` to set a maximum payment limit per call if you want to control spending.

## Multiple Servers

Connect to multiple servers at once:

```bash
cronos402 connect \
  -u https://weather.example.com/mcp,https://data.example.com/mcp \
  -e 0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
  -n cronos-testnet
```
