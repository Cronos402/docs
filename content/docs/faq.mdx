---

## General

**What is Cronos402?**
Cronos402 is a **payment layer for MCP and HTTP servers on Cronos blockchain**. It implements the [x402 protocol](https://x402.org), which lets any client (human app or AI agent) call a tool, get payment requirements with price metadata, pay on-chain with USDC.e or CRO, and retry automatically.

**Do I have to use MCP?**
Yes.

**Who is Cronos402 for?**
- **Providers** who want to **monetize per-call access** to their APIs/tools on Cronos.
- **Agents/Integrators** who need **programmatic, per-request payments** without API keys or subscriptions.
- **Builders** who want the **fastest path** to ship a paid MCP server on Cronos.

**What's the Cronos402 Registry?**
A public catalog of MCP servers and their priced tools. It shows metadata, usage stats, and integration snippets. Browse at [Servers](/servers).

## How it works

**What is x402 and the 402 flow?**
1. Client calls a protected route/tool.
2. Service responds with `402` and metadata (`asset, amount, destination, memo, expiry`).
3. Client (or Cronos402 proxy/SDK) **pays on-chain** with USDC.e (gasless) or CRO.
4. Request is retried with payment proof.
5. Response succeeds.

**Is this "Stripe for agents"?**
It has a similar goal — enabling monetization — but different mechanics: no API keys, no subscriptions, no dashboards. It's **pay-per-call at protocol level**, natively understood by agents.

**Can humans also pay?**
Yes. If the request comes from a browser, wallet extensions or embedded wallets can complete the same 402 payment flow.

## Pricing & Business

**What pricing models are supported?**
- **Flat per call** (default).
- **Tiered or per-tool** pricing.
- **Dynamic pricing** <span style={{

**Does Cronos402 take a cut?**
No by default — payments are routed **directly to your wallet**. If you use managed wallets or optional hosted features, platform fees may apply.

**Do you support revenue splits?**
Splits can be implemented by emitting multiple accepted destinations in 402 metadata, or handled off-chain. Native splits are on the roadmap. <span style={{

## Payments, Wallets & Chains

**Which chains/tokens are supported?**

Cronos402 is built exclusively for **Cronos blockchain**:
- **USDC.e** (gasless payments via Cronos facilitator)
- **Native CRO** (direct payments)

Supported networks:
- Cronos Mainnet (Chain ID: 25)
- Cronos Testnet (Chain ID: 338)

**What wallets can be used?**
- **EOAs** via private key (for dev/test).
- **CDP/embedded wallets** (better UX).
- **Browser wallets** for humans.

**How do I cap spend?**
Set `maxPaymentValue` in the SDK (denominated in base units, e.g. 6 decimals for USDC.e, 18 for CRO). This ensures per-call spend cannot exceed a limit.

---

## Security & Reliability

**Do you store private keys?**
- In SDK mode, keys remain on your server/client.
- With managed wallets, keys stay with the wallet provider; Cronos402 only verifies proofs.

**Rate limits & DoS?**
The proxy includes **basic rate limiting**, header scrubbing, and GET caching. Standard API security (WAF, throttling) is still recommended.

---

## SDK, CLI & DevEx

**Which languages are supported?**
Official **TypeScript SDK + CLI**. Any language can integrate by handling `402` and sending back an `X-PAYMENT` proof.

**How do I integrate quickly?**
With the CLI:

```bash
npx cronos402 connect --urls https://cronos402.dev/mcp/<id> --evm 0xYOUR_KEY
```

**How do I define paid tools in code?**

Check the SDK [here](/quickstart/sdk)

```ts
import { createMcpPaidHandler } from "cronos402/handler"

export const paidMcp = createMcpPaidHandler(
  async (server) => {
    server.paidTool(
      "hello",
      "say hello",
      "$0.001",
      {},
      async () => ({ content: [{ type: "text", text: "Hello, world!" }] })
    )
  },
  {
    recipient: { evm: { address: "0xYOUR_ADDRESS" } }
  }
)

```

## Legal

**Are you affiliated with the APIs I wrap?**

No. Cronos402 is an integration layer. Wrapped APIs remain independent and subject to their own terms.
